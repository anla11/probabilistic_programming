# Probabilistic Programming
This project includes notebook files that show experiments of using probabilistic programming:

1. Examples of using Pyro, Pytorch and PYMC3

  [Pyro+Pytorch: Basic functions and models](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/Pyro-Pytorch_Basic-functions-and-models.ipynb)
  
  [Pyro+Pytorhc: Training with ELBO+SVI](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/Pyro-Pytorch_Training-with-ELBO-SVI.ipynb)
  
  [PYMC3 - Classification with IRIS dataset](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/PYMC3_Classify-with-Iris.ipynb)
   
2. Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF)

   [With Movielen100k Dataset](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/Probabilistic_Matrix_Factorization.ipynb)
     
   [With OnlineRetail Dataset](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/Online_Retail_with_ProbMF.ipynb)

3. Variational Autoencoder

  [Experiments with Probabilistic VAE](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/VAE.ipynb)

4. Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm (EM), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Gaussian Process (GP)

   [EM.ipynb](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/BayesianML_Coursera/Week_2_Bayesian_ML_em_assignment.ipynb)

   [MCMC.ipynb](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/BayesianML_Coursera/Week_4_Bayesian_ML_mcmc_assignment.ipynb)

   [VAE.ipynb](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/BayesianML_Coursera/Week_5_Bayesian_ML_Vae_assignment.ipynb)

   [GP.ipynb](https://github.com/anla11/probabilistic_programming/blob/main/BayesianML_Coursera/Week_6_Bayesian_ML_GP_assignment.ipynb)

   These are assignment from the online course in Coursera: [Bayesian Methods for Machine Learning
](https://www.classcentral.com/course/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning-9604)
